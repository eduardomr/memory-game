# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game built with Javascript, HTML and CSS. The game is a grid of 12 cards, each with a different symbol on one side. The player clicks on a card to reveal the symbol, then clicks on another card to try to find the matching symbol. If the symbols match, the cards stay face up. If the symbols do not match, the cards are flipped back over. The game ends when all cards have been matched.

The implementation of this game is based on [Memory-Game Tutorial](https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game/), but with some modifications. This project is a a nice way to learn about Javascript, HTML and CSS. Enjoy it! =)
